Introduction
****************
This application accompanies the Splunk conf 2017 presentation "How did you get so big? Tips and tricks for growing your Splunk installation from 50GB/day to 1TB/day"

The general idea is to provide a few dashboards that relate to troubleshooting indexer/heavy forwarder performance issues and alerts that detect a variety of failure or potential failure scenarios within Splunk
Many of the alerts are informational and the description (described near the end of this document) explains which alerts are likely to generate the most noise.
All alerts are disabled by default

The original presentation is available as a recording http://conf.splunk.com/files/2017/recordings/howd-you-get-so-big-tips-n-tricks-for-growing-your-splunk-deployment-from-50-gb-per-day-to-1-tb-per-day.mp4 or PDF http://conf.splunk.com/files/2017/slides/howd-you-get-so-big-tips-tricks-for-growing-your-splunk-deployment-from-50-gb-day-to-1-tb-day.pdf
The powerpoint should it be required is available on https://github.com/gjanders/splunkconf2017

Macros - required configuration
****************

The various saved searches and dashboards use macros within their searches, you will need to update the macros to ensure the searches/dashboards work as expected.

The macros are listed below, many expect a host=A OR host=B item to assist in narrowing down a search while others expect only a single value...

indexerhosts - a host=... list of your indexers (for example host=indexer1 OR host=indexer2)

heavyforwarderhosts - a host=... list of your heavy forwarders (for example host=heavyforwarder1 OR host=heavyforwarder2)

searchheadhosts - a host=... list of your search head(s) (for example host=searchhead1 OR host=searchhead2)

splunkenterprisehosts - a host=... list of any Splunk enterprise instance (for example host=indexer1 OR host=searchhead1 OR ...)

deploymentserverhosts - a host=... list of deployment server(s) (for example host=splunkdeploymentserver)

licensemasterhost - a host=... entry for the license master server (for example host=splunklicensemaster)

splunkenterprisehostsvalue - a ... (1 value only) entry/wildcard for Splunk enterprise hosts (will be used in cases where splunk_servers=?) (for example splunk*)

searchheadsplunkservers - a ... (1 value only) entry/wildcard for search head hosts (will be used in cases where splunk_servers=?) (for example searchhead*)

splunkindexerhostsvalue - a ... (1 value only) entry/wildcard of indexer hosts (will be used in cases where splunk_servers=?) (for example indexer*)

The macros are used in various alerts which you can optionally enable, the alerts will raise a triggered alert only as emails are not allowed for Splunk app certification purposes 

****************
Using the application
****************

Once the application is installed, *all* alerts are disabled by default and you can enable those you require or want to test in your local environment.
If you choose not to cutomise the macros then many searches will search for all hosts, which will make the alerts and dashboards inaccurate!

****************
Which alerts should be enabled?
****************
The alerts are all useful for detecting a variety of different scenarios which may or may not be applicable within your Splunk environment.
The description field has an (extremely) simple way of determining if an alert will require action there are three levels:
Low - the alert is informational and likely relates to a potential issue, these alerts may produce false alarms
Moderate - the alert is a warning and most likely action will need to be taken, a moderate chance of false alarms
High - the alert is likely relating to something that requires action and there is a very slim chance that is a false alarm

I do not have a nice way to auto-enable various alerts excluding editing the local/savedsearches.conf
